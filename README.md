# SOLID-And-Design-Patterns

Codes for SOLID and Design Patterns that I've been studying as long as a brief (or not)
explanation of each one.

The packages are divided into 2 (sometimes 3) parts:

1. before.refactor - Codes before the refactor, that contains problems and are not scalable.
2. after.refactor - Codes after the refactor, that fixes the problems related to the topic.
3. mocked.utils _(optional)_ - Codes that are not necessarily related to the refactor, but
   to the context itself. Does not appear in every code.

Inside every topic, there's a brief explanation of the context of the code and how to
better it, using the context of the principle or pattern described.
